Planning to implement:

light

mesh

shading

Implemented:

light -- can add multiple lights in scripting.

mesh -- can handle .obj files with triangles and quadrilaterals. Ignores textures.

shading -- flat, wireframe, gouraud, and phong options

(this isn't new, but as it is related, I also added a few custom commands to MDL a few assignments ago: triangle, for creating an individual triangle, and set_default, for changing the default color mid-script)
